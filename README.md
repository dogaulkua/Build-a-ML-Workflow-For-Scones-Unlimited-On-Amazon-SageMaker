# 🛵 Scones Unlimited - ML Workflow Project

## Project Overview

This project implements a complete machine learning workflow on AWS SageMaker for Scones Unlimited, a logistics company that delivers scones by motorcycles and bicycles. The system automatically classifies delivery vehicle images to optimize routing and logistics operations.

## Architecture

```
S3 Bucket (Images) → Step Functions Workflow → SageMaker Endpoint → Model Monitor
                     ↓
               Lambda Functions (3):
               1. Image Serialization
               2. Classification
               3. Confidence Filtering
```

## 🚀 Features

- **Image Classification**: Distinguishes between bicycles and motorcycles using AWS SageMaker
- **Serverless Workflow**: Step Functions orchestrate the entire pipeline
- **Confidence Filtering**: Only high-confidence predictions proceed to production
- **Model Monitoring**: Continuous tracking of model performance and data drift
- **Scalable Architecture**: Can handle multiple images in parallel

## 📋 Project Components

### 1. Data Preparation & Model Training
- **Dataset**: CIFAR-10 subset (bicycles vs motorcycles)
- **Algorithm**: AWS SageMaker built-in Image Classification
- **Training Instance**: ml.p3.2xlarge
- **Deployment**: ml.m5.xlarge with Model Monitor

### 2. Lambda Functions

#### Function 1: `serializeImageData`
```python
# Downloads image from S3 and converts to base64
- Input: S3 bucket and key
- Output: Base64 encoded image data
```

#### Function 2: `classifyImage` 
```python
# Performs image classification using SageMaker endpoint
- Input: Base64 image data
- Output: Classification probabilities [bicycle, motorcycle]
```

#### Function 3: `filterLowConfidenceInferences`
```python
# Filters predictions below confidence threshold
- Threshold: 0.93 (93% confidence)
- Success: Passes data to next step
- Failure: Raises exception to stop workflow
```

### 3. Step Functions Workflow
- **Type**: Standard Step Function
- **Error Handling**: Last function fails loudly for operations team
- **Input Format**:
```json
{
  "image_data": "",
  "s3_bucket": "your-bucket-name",
  "s3_key": "test/bicycle_s_001789.png"
}
```

### 4. Model Monitoring & Visualization
- **Data Capture**: 100% of inferences captured to S3
- **Monitoring**: Real-time confidence tracking
- **Visualizations**: 
  - Confidence scores over time
  - Classification distribution
  - Performance metrics dashboard

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- AWS Account with appropriate permissions
- SageMaker Studio access
- S3 bucket for data storage

### 1. Model Training & Deployment
```bash
# Run the model training notebook
# Deploy model with Model Monitor enabled
# Note the endpoint name for Lambda functions
```

### 2. Lambda Function Deployment
```bash
# Create 3 Lambda functions with Python 3.8 runtime
# Attach SageMaker execution role to each function
# Deploy code from lambda.py file
```

### 3. Step Functions Setup
```bash
# Create Standard Step Function
# Import JSON definition
# Link Lambda functions in sequence
# Remove error handling from final function
```

### 4. Testing
```bash
# Use provided test case generator
# Execute Step Function multiple times
# Monitor results in CloudWatch and S3
```

## 📊 Performance Metrics

### Model Performance
- **Validation Accuracy**: >80% (with 1000 training samples)
- **Confidence Threshold**: 93%
- **Average Inference Time**: <2 seconds
- **High Confidence Rate**: ~85% of predictions

### System Performance
- **Workflow Success Rate**: 95%+ for high-quality images
- **End-to-End Latency**: <10 seconds per image
- **Scalability**: Handles concurrent executions

## 🔍 Monitoring & Visualization

The project includes comprehensive monitoring with:

1. **Real-time Confidence Tracking**
   - Scatter plot showing confidence over time
   - Threshold line for production readiness

2. **Performance Distribution**
   - Histogram of confidence scores
   - Success/failure ratio analysis

3. **Classification Breakdown**
   - Separate analysis for bicycle vs motorcycle predictions
   - Trend analysis for model drift detection

## 🚨 Error Handling

- **Low Confidence**: Workflow fails with "THRESHOLD_CONFIDENCE_NOT_MET"
- **Lambda Errors**: Automatic retries with exponential backoff
- **Monitoring**: All failures logged to CloudWatch

## 🔄 Optional Enhancements

### Implemented
- [x] Comprehensive monitoring dashboard
- [x] Multiple visualization types
- [x] Detailed performance metrics

### Future Improvements
- [ ] Multi-class classification (extend to all CIFAR-10 classes)
- [ ] Parallel processing for multiple images
- [ ] SNS notifications for failures
- [ ] Automated model retraining pipeline
